#How to run
1. If using windows you run Xampp and do the local hosting; which is always straightfoward
2. Those using Linux distros such as Ubuntu, Kali Linux and LinuxMint you have to run Xampp using the terminal commands i.e sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start ,which is the easiest of the available commands.
3. Next step is to now input the local url into favorable browser i.e localhost/"name of the repo" and you're ready to go.
4.If you want to host remotely you can as well us Ngrok or Pagekite
